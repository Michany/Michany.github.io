Hi there.  
I am @Michany (Michael Wang), an undergraduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, major in Finance, second major in Computer and its Applications.  
Expect to get my Bachelor's Degree in 2020. 

I've been working in some hedge hunds in Shanghai as a quantitative research intern.

##### Future Careers

I'm going to persue my Master's Degree on Financial Engineering (MFE) in 2020 Fall.
