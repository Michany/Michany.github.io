#### Lyrics
> If you lie to me by  
> Three courses to try  
> If you never felt defined to  
> Speak all your mind  
> Cause you know we begin  
> In this fortune to sin  
> And I see that  
> You know the smell my hospital brings  
> And I know you before  
> You face all the doors  (x2)
>  
> But if you could receive  
> In silence you leave  
> And love never knelt these nineteen  
> Paces from me  
> And if I’d followed you  
> In an open canoe  
> And if I’d never liked the shirts with  
> Stripes and the news  
> That I know you before  
> You face all the doors  (x2)
